Big O notation is a way to represent the relative complexity of algorithms.The notation is useful when comparing algorithms used for similar purposes. Seeing the Big O of multiplication algorithms would allow you to compare their relative complexity. It wouldn't be useful to see the Big O of a multiplication algorithm and an addition algorithm side-by-side.Big O reduces an algorithm to the most significant portion of complexity. If an algorithm could be represented as n2 + n, as the inputs became large, the + n would become meaningless in the overall complexity and could be dropped. The same holds true for n3 + n2 + n, as this would be simplified to n3.
